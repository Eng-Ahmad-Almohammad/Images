## Adding Images
## < img >
### To add an image into the page you need to use an < img > element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes.
## src
### This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. (Here you can see that the images are in a child folder called *images*
## alt
### This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.
## Height & Width of Images
- [x] height: This specifies the height of the image in pixels.

- [x] width: This specifies the width of the image in pixels.
