# Images
## Adding Images
## < img >
### To add an image into the page you need to use an < img > element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes.
## src
### This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. (Here you can see that the images are in a child folder called *images*
## alt
### This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.
## Height & Width of Images
- [x] height: This specifies the height of the image in pixels.

- [x] width: This specifies the width of the image in pixels.

## Three Rules for Creating Images
### There are three rules to remember when you are creating images for your website which are summarized below. 
### 1- Save images in the right format
### 2-Save images at the right size
### 3- Use the correct resolution
##  Figure and Figure Caption < figure > < figcaption >
### Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced a new < figure > element to contain images and their caption so that the two are associated. You can have more than one image inside the < figure> element as long as they all share the same caption.
### The < figcaption> element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image. Before these elements were created there was no way to associate an < img> element with its caption.
